# GitHub Copilot Commit Message Instructions

Follow the Conventional Commits specification.
The commit message should be structured as follows:

<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

## Rules

- The commit message must start with a type (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci)
- The type should be followed by an optional scope in parentheses, then a colon and a space.
- The first line (subject) should be a short, descriptive summary of 50 characters or less.
- The body should provide more detailed context, if necessary.
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
