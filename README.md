## 🎯 Why PeopleDear?

Managing people shouldn't be complicated. Between tracking overtime, approving time-off requests, handling expenses, and ensuring everything is properly documented—small businesses waste hours on administrative tasks that could be automated.

**PeopleDear simplifies people management** with smart automation:
- ✅ **Automated overtime calculations** based on your business rules
- ✅ **Smart time-off tracking** with conflict detection
- ✅ **Multi-level approval workflows** that actually work
- ✅ **Clean data exports** for seamless payroll integration

**What we're NOT:** We're not a payroll system. We focus on collecting accurate data and streamlining approvals, so you can export clean, verified information to your payroll processor.
