# PeopleDear Product Mission

## Product Vision

PeopleDear is a compliance-first HR management platform designed specifically for small businesses in Portugal navigating the complexities of Portuguese labor law. We empower organizations to accurately track overtime, manage time-off, and streamline expense approvals without the burden of manual calculations or payroll processing.

## Problem Statement

Small businesses in Portugal face a unique challenge: Portuguese labor law governing overtime, time-off, and employee compensation is exceptionally complex and error-prone to manage manually.

### The Complexity We Solve

**Overtime Calculation Intricacies:**
- Weekday overtime: First hour at base rate +50%, subsequent hours until 22:00 at base rate +100%
- Saturday work: Double pay rate
- Sunday work: Employee entitled to 2 compensatory days off
- Holiday work: Separate calculation rules apply

**Administrative Burdens:**
- Manual tracking of extra hours, time-off requests, and holiday approvals
- Paper-based processes creating approval bottlenecks
- Error-prone data collection for payroll processors
- Lack of transparency between management and employees

**Business Challenges:**
- Cost management for business trips (subsistence allowances)
- Expense report tracking and approval workflows
- Ensuring compliance with Portuguese labor law
- Coordinating time-off with national, regional, and local holidays

## Our Solution

PeopleDear provides a **data collection and approval workflow platform** that:

1. **Automates Complex Calculations**: Built-in Portuguese labor law rules ensure accurate overtime, time-off, and compensation calculations
2. **Streamlines Approvals**: Multi-level approval workflows with email notifications and mobile-friendly interfaces
3. **Ensures Compliance**: Holiday conflict detection and automatic application of regional/local holiday rules
4. **Exports Clean Data**: Integration-ready exports for existing payroll processing systems
5. **Empowers Employees**: Self-service portal for requests with document upload capabilities
