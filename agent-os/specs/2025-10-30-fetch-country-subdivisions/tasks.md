# Task Breakdown: Fetch Country Subdivisions from OpenHolidays API

## Overview
Total Task Groups: 6
Total Tasks: 25

This feature integrates OpenHolidays API subdivision fetching into the InstallCommand to automatically populate CountrySubdivision records for Portugal and Spain during installation, with proper type mapping, nested hierarchy support, and error handling.

## Task List

### Phase 1: Configuration & Setup

#### Task Group 1: Type Mapping Configuration & Upsert Investigation
**Dependencies:** None

- [ ] 1.0 Complete subdivision type mapping configuration and upsert investigation
  - [ ] 1.1 Investigate CreateCountrySubdivision for upsert support
    - Check if `iso_code` has unique constraint in `country_subdivisions` table
    - Review if `CreateCountrySubdivision` needs updating from `create()` to `updateOrCreate()`
    - If upsert needed, match on `iso_code` field
    - Write 1-2 tests for upsert behavior (create new, update existing)
    - Update action if necessary to support re-running installation
  - [ ] 1.2 Write 2-4 focused tests for OpenHolidaysSubdivisionType enum
    - Test transform() method maps to correct CountrySubdivisionType
    - Test fallback/default type handling
    - Test all expected subdivision types from fixtures
  - [ ] 1.3 Create OpenHolidaysSubdivisionType enum
    - File: `app/Enums/Integrations/OpenHolidays/OpenHolidaysSubdivisionType.php`
    - Follow pattern from OpenHolidaysHolidayType.php
    - Add cases: District, Region, Municipality, Parish, Community, Province
    - Implement transform() method returning CountrySubdivisionType
    - Add sensible fallback for unmapped types (default to District)
    - Note: Additional types will be discovered during fixture analysis
  - [ ] 1.4 Add rate limiting configuration to config/openholidays.php
    - Add 'rate_limit' array with 'delay_ms' key (default: 500)
    - Document purpose: prevent API rate limiting between country requests
    - Place in configuration alongside existing cache settings
  - [ ] 1.5 Ensure type mapping tests pass
    - Run ONLY the 2-4 tests written in 1.1
    - Verify enum cases map correctly to CountrySubdivisionType

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- OpenHolidaysSubdivisionType enum created with transform() method
- The 2-4 tests written in 1.1 pass
- Rate limiting configuration added to config file
- Enum follows existing OpenHolidaysHolidayType pattern

**Technical Notes:**
- Subdivision type mapping may need updates after analyzing API fixtures in Phase 5
- Rate limit delay should be configurable for different environments

    - Use getLocalizedName() for name array transformation
    - Recursively transform children maintaining hierarchy
    - Inject CreateCountrySubdivisionData for nested children
  - [ ] 2.4 Add helper method for language parsing

      - Call CreateRootCountrySubdivision->handle() passing the transformed data
      - Orchestrator handles ALL recursion, transactions, and persistence automatically
  - [ ] 3.4 Apply rate limiting between country requests
    - Use config('openholidays.rate_limit.delay_ms', 500)
    - Call usleep(delay * 1000) between country iterations

  - [ ] 3.6 Ensure InstallCommand tests pass
    - Run ONLY the 2-4 tests written in 3.1

## Execution Order

Recommended implementation sequence:
1. **Phase 1: Configuration & Setup** (Task Group 1) - No dependencies, foundational setup
2. **Phase 2: API Data Adapter** (Task Group 2) - Depends on type mapping configuration
3. **Phase 3: InstallCommand Integration** (Task Group 3) - Depends on adapter being ready
4. **Phase 4: Error Handling & Logging** (Task Group 4) - Depends on basic integration working
5. **Phase 5: Testing with Fixtures** (Task Group 5) - Depends on all implementation complete
6. **Phase 6: Documentation** (Task Group 6) - Final step after everything works

## Key Technical Decisions

**Action Pattern Architecture:**
- `CreateRootCountrySubdivision` - Orchestrates the entire process (handles recursion, hierarchy, transactions)
- `CreateCountrySubdivision` - Low-level persistence (saves single subdivision to database)
- No new upsert action needed - existing actions handle all requirements

**Implementation Flow:**
```
InstallCommand (spin block #2)
  → Iterate PT, ES countries
  → Fetch from OpenHolidays API (GetSubdivisionsRequest)
  → OpenHolidaysSubdivisionAdapter transforms to CreateCountrySubdivisionData
  → Call CreateRootCountrySubdivision (orchestrates entire hierarchy)
    → Strips children from parent data
    → Calls CreateCountrySubdivision (saves parent to DB)
    → Recursively processes children via createChildren()
      → For each child, strips grandchildren
      → Calls CreateCountrySubdivision (saves child with parent_id)
      → Recursively processes grandchildren
  → Rate limiting delay between countries
  → Error handling per country with logging
```

**Critical Integration Points:**
- InstallCommand integrates after country seeding completes
- Adapter transforms nested API data to nested CreateCountrySubdivisionData
- CreateRootCountrySubdivision handles DB transactions and recursion automatically
- Error handling ensures installation robustness

**Testing Strategy:**
- Limit test writing during development: 2-6 tests per task group
- Focus on critical behaviors only during development
- Use Saloon fixtures for realistic, deterministic testing
- Gap analysis in Phase 5 adds maximum 6 additional strategic tests
- Total expected tests: approximately 14-24 tests for entire feature
- Run only feature-specific tests, not entire suite
