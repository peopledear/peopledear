# Task 9: Email

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Phase 9 from `agent-os/specs/20251015-admin-user-management/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement the email notification system for user invitations. This includes creating a Mailable class and a Blade markdown email template that will be sent when administrators invite new users to the platform.

## Implementation Summary
Created a complete email system for sending user invitations. The implementation follows Laravel 12's mailable architecture using the `Envelope` and `Content` pattern with markdown email templates. The email contains all necessary information for invited users including the invitation link, role assignment, inviter name, and expiration date.

The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing `CreateInvitation` and `ResendInvitation` actions, which already reference the `UserInvitationMail` class. The email uses Laravel's built-in markdown mail components for consistent styling and includes a prominent call-to-action button for accepting the invitation.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `app/Mail/UserInvitationMail.php` - Mailable class that handles invitation email construction and data preparation
- `resources/views/emails/invitation.blade.php` - Blade markdown template for the invitation email with branded design

### Modified Files
None - this implementation completed missing files that were already referenced by existing Actions

## Key Implementation Details

### UserInvitationMail Mailable Class
**Location:** `app/Mail/UserInvitationMail.php`

The mailable class uses constructor property promotion to accept an `Invitation` model instance, making the entire invitation relationship data available to the email template. The class is marked as `final` following Laravel Boost guidelines.

**Key Features:**
- Uses `Envelope` for email subject configuration
- Uses `Content` with markdown view for email body
- Eager loads relationships (`inviter` and `role`) via the Invitation model
- Passes formatted data to the view: invitation URL, inviter name, role display name, and formatted expiration date
- Subject line: "You have been invited to PeopleDear"

**Rationale:** This approach leverages Laravel's relationship eager loading to minimize queries while providing all necessary data to the email template. Using markdown ensures consistent email styling across all email clients.

### Invitation Email Template
**Location:** `resources/views/emails/invitation.blade.php`

The email template uses Laravel's `<x-mail::message>` and `<x-mail::button>` components for consistent, responsive email design.

**Structure:**
1. Welcome heading
2. Personalized invitation message with inviter name and assigned role
3. Call-to-action button linking to invitation acceptance page
4. Expiration notice with formatted date
5. Support contact instructions
6. Footer with application name

**Rationale:** The markdown component approach ensures emails render consistently across all email clients (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, etc.) while maintaining professional branding. The clear hierarchy guides users through the invitation acceptance process.

## Dependencies (if applicable)

### Existing Dependencies Used
- `App\Models\Invitation` - Provides invitation data and relationships
- `App\Actions\CreateInvitation` - Sends email when invitation is created
- `App\Actions\ResendInvitation` - Sends email when invitation is resent
- Laravel Mail system - Handles email delivery
- Laravel Markdown Mail - Provides email components

### Configuration Dependencies
Email functionality requires proper mail configuration in `.env`:
- `MAIL_MAILER` - Mail driver (e.g., mailgun, smtp)
- `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` - Sender email address
- `MAIL_FROM_NAME` - Sender name (defaults to app name)

For Mailgun:
- `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` - Mailgun domain
- `MAILGUN_SECRET` - Mailgun API key

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
None - Email functionality will be tested as part of feature tests in Phase 13:
- `InvitationControllerTest.php` - Will test that emails are sent when invitations are created
- `ResendInvitationControllerTest.php` - Will test that emails are sent when invitations are resent

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ⚠️ Deferred to Phase 13
- Integration tests: ⚠️ Deferred to Phase 13
- Edge cases covered: Will be tested in Phase 13 using `Mail::fake()`

### Manual Testing Performed
To manually test email sending (recommended after configuring Mailgun):

```php
// In Laravel Tinker
php artisan tinker

// Create test invitation
$role = \App\Models\Role::where('name', 'employee')->first();
$admin = \App\Models\User::where('role_id', \App\Models\Role::where('name', 'admin')->first()->id)->first();

$invitation = \App\Models\Invitation::create([
    'email' => 'test@example.com',
    'role_id' => $role->id,
    'invited_by' => $admin->id,
]);

// Send test email
\Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail::to($invitation->email)
    ->send(new \App\Mail\UserInvitationMail($invitation));
```

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Laravel Boost Guidelines
**File Reference:** `CLAUDE.md` - Laravel Boost Guidelines

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Constructor Property Promotion**: Used `public Invitation $invitation` in constructor following PHP 8 patterns
- **Final Classes**: Made `UserInvitationMail` class `final` as required
- **Method Chaining on New Lines**: Each method call in the Content definition is on its own line for readability
- **Type Declarations**: All methods have explicit return type declarations (`Envelope`, `Content`)
- **Do Things the Laravel Way**: Used `php artisan make:mail` command to generate initial file structure

**Deviations:** None

---

### Global Coding Style
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Used `declare(strict_types=1);` at the top of PHP files
- Followed PSR-12 coding standards
- Used descriptive variable names: `$inviterName`, `$roleName`, `$expiresAt`
- Ran `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` to ensure code formatting compliance

**Deviations:** None

---

### Backend API Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
While this task doesn't directly create API endpoints, it follows backend patterns:
- Clean separation of concerns (Mailable handles email logic, template handles presentation)
- Data is prepared in the Mailable class and passed to the view
- Uses Laravel's built-in features (Mailable, Markdown Mail) rather than custom solutions

**Deviations:** None - API standards are not directly applicable to email implementation

---

### Global Conventions
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- File naming follows Laravel conventions: `UserInvitationMail.php` (singular, descriptive)
- Directory structure follows Laravel standards: `app/Mail/`, `resources/views/emails/`
- Method naming is clear and descriptive: `envelope()`, `content()`
- Template variable naming is descriptive: `$inviterName` not `$name`, `$roleName` not `$role`

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### Internal Dependencies
- **CreateInvitation Action** (`app/Actions/CreateInvitation.php`)
  - Calls: `Mail::to($invitation->email)->send(new UserInvitationMail($invitation))`
  - Sends email immediately after creating invitation record

- **ResendInvitation Action** (`app/Actions/ResendInvitation.php`)
  - Calls: `Mail::to($invitation->email)->send(new UserInvitationMail($invitation))`
  - Sends email after updating invitation expiration

### Route Integration
The email contains a route URL to the invitation acceptance page:
- Route: `invitation.show`
- Parameter: `$invitation->token`
- Full URL generated via: `route('invitation.show', $this->invitation->token)`

### Model Relationships Used
- `Invitation::inviter()` - BelongsTo User - Gets the name of admin who sent invitation
- `Invitation::role()` - BelongsTo Role - Gets the display name of assigned role

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified

### Limitations
1. **Email Delivery Dependent on Configuration**
   - Description: Email sending requires proper mail driver configuration (Mailgun, SMTP, etc.)
   - Reason: Laravel's mail system requires valid credentials and configuration
   - Future Consideration: Consider adding email preview functionality in development environment

2. **No Email Tracking**
   - Description: System doesn't track whether emails were opened or clicked
   - Reason: Basic implementation focuses on sending functionality
   - Future Consideration: Could integrate with Mailgun's tracking features or third-party services

3. **Single Language Support**
   - Description: Email template is in English only
   - Reason: Initial implementation doesn't include internationalization
   - Future Consideration: Add Laravel localization support for multi-language emails

## Performance Considerations
- Emails are sent synchronously in the current implementation
- For production, consider queuing emails using Laravel's queue system by adding `ShouldQueue` interface to the Mailable class
- This would prevent user-facing delays when sending invitations
- Example modification: `class UserInvitationMail extends Mailable implements ShouldQueue`

## Security Considerations
1. **Token Security**: Email contains unique UUID token that cannot be guessed
2. **Expiration**: Email clearly communicates 7-day expiration period
3. **No Sensitive Data**: Email doesn't contain passwords or sensitive information
4. **Secure Links**: Uses Laravel's `route()` helper which generates properly formatted URLs
5. **Email Address Validation**: Invitation email is validated before being sent (handled by InviteUserRequest)

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
Phase 13 (Testing) will test this email functionality:
- Task 13.2: InvitationControllerTest - Tests that invitation emails are sent
- Task 13.4: ResendInvitationControllerTest - Tests that resend emails are sent

## Notes
- The email template uses Laravel's markdown mail components which automatically handle responsive design and cross-email-client compatibility
- The invitation URL uses the token parameter which is already unique and secure (UUID)
- Email styling is controlled by Laravel's mail configuration and can be customized by publishing mail views
- To preview the email during development, consider using tools like Mailpit or Mailtrap
- The mailable can be easily queued for async sending by implementing `ShouldQueue` interface when needed for production
