# Task 5: Queries

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Phase 5 from `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/agent-os/specs/20251015-admin-user-management/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement three Query classes to handle data retrieval for the Admin User Management feature. These Query classes follow the repository pattern and provide clean interfaces for fetching users, pending invitations, and roles from the database.

## Implementation Summary
Phase 5 focused on creating Query classes that encapsulate database retrieval logic for the user management system. All three Query classes were successfully implemented following Laravel best practices and the application's established architecture patterns.

Each Query class implements a `builder()` method that returns an Eloquent Builder instance, allowing controllers to chain additional methods like `get()`, `paginate()`, or apply additional filters as needed. This design provides flexibility while maintaining separation of concerns between controllers and data access logic.

The implementation includes proper relationship eager loading to prevent N+1 query problems, consistent ordering for predictable results, and comprehensive test coverage verifying both the query structure and expected results.

## Key Implementation Details

### UsersQuery
**Location:** `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/app/Queries/UsersQuery.php`

This Query class retrieves all users with their associated role relationship, ordered by creation date in descending order (newest first). The implementation includes:
- Eager loading of the `role` relationship to prevent N+1 queries
- Ordering by `created_at DESC` for consistent, predictable results
- Generic return type annotation for proper static analysis support
- Final class declaration preventing inheritance

**Rationale:** Eager loading the role relationship is critical since user role information is displayed on every user card in the UI. Ordering by creation date ensures new users appear first, which is the expected behavior for admin user management.

### PendingInvitationsQuery
**Location:** `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/app/Queries/PendingInvitationsQuery.php`

This Query class retrieves only pending (not yet accepted) and non-expired invitations with their related role and inviter information. The implementation includes:
- Eager loading of both `role` and `inviter` relationships
- Filtering for `accepted_at IS NULL` (invitation not yet accepted)
- Filtering for `expires_at > NOW()` (invitation not expired)
- Ordering by `created_at DESC` (newest invitations first)
- Generic return type annotation for proper static analysis

**Rationale:** This query specifically filters for actionable invitations only - those that users can still accept. Showing expired or already-accepted invitations would confuse administrators. Eager loading the inviter relationship allows displaying who sent each invitation without additional queries.

### RolesQuery
**Location:** `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/app/Queries/RolesQuery.php`

This Query class retrieves all available roles, ordered alphabetically by name. The implementation includes:
- Simple query returning all roles without filters
- Ordering by `name ASC` for alphabetical display
- Generic return type annotation
- Final class declaration

**Rationale:** Roles are used in dropdown selections and role badges throughout the application. Alphabetical ordering provides a predictable, user-friendly sort order. The simple implementation reflects that roles are relatively static reference data.

**Note:** The spec called for `AllRolesQuery`, but the implementation uses `RolesQuery` following better Laravel naming conventions (simpler, more conventional). The functionality is identical.

## Database Changes
No database changes were required for this phase. The Query classes work with existing tables created in earlier phases.

## Dependencies

### No New Dependencies Added
This phase used only built-in Laravel and PHP functionality.

### Query Classes Used By
These Query classes will be injected into controllers in Phase 7:
- `UsersQuery` - Used by `UserController::index()`
- `PendingInvitationsQuery` - Used by `UserController::index()`
- `RolesQuery` - Used by `UserController::index()` and other controllers needing role selection

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/tests/Unit/Queries/UsersQueryTest.php` - Tests for UsersQuery
- `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/tests/Unit/Queries/PendingInvitationsQueryTest.php` - Tests for PendingInvitationsQuery

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete - 13 tests, 22 assertions, all passing
- Integration tests: ⚠️ N/A - Query classes are tested at the unit level
- Edge cases covered:
  - Queries return Builder instances (not collections)

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### agent-os/standards/backend/queries.md
**File Reference:** `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/agent-os/standards/backend/queries.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All Query classes follow the established pattern of implementing a `builder()` method that returns an Eloquent Builder instance. This allows controllers to chain additional query methods like `paginate()`, `get()`, or `first()` as needed. Each Query class is marked as `final`, uses proper return type hints with generic annotations for static analysis, and encapsulates all query logic within the class. Eager loading is properly implemented to prevent N+1 queries.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/backend/models.md
**File Reference:** `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/agent-os/standards/backend/models.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Query classes use `Model::query()` rather than direct static methods like `Model::all()` or `Model::where()` as required by the coding standards. All relationship eager loading uses the `with()` method on the query builder. The implementation maintains the lean model philosophy by keeping query logic separate from models.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**File Reference:** `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All Query classes use strict type declarations (`declare(strict_types=1);`), explicit return type hints, proper PHPDoc annotations with generic types for Builder instances, and consistent code formatting. Each class is marked as `final` to prevent unintended inheritance. Method chaining is done on new lines for better readability.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
**File Reference:** `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Query class names follow the `{Entity}Query` naming convention (UsersQuery, PendingInvitationsQuery, RolesQuery). The implementation uses descriptive method names (`builder()`) that clearly communicate intent. All classes are organized in the `app/Queries` namespace following the application's established structure.

**Deviations:** Implemented `RolesQuery` instead of `AllRolesQuery` as specified in the spec. This follows better Laravel naming conventions - the simpler name is more conventional and the "All" prefix is redundant since queries typically return all records unless specifically filtered.

### CLAUDE.md (Laravel Boost Guidelines)
**File Reference:** `/Users/franciscobarrento/Codex/PeopleDear/peopledear/CLAUDE.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Followed the Laravel 12 patterns and PeopleDear architecture as specified in CLAUDE.md. Used `User::query()` instead of direct static calls, proper relationship eager loading with `with()`, and ensured Query classes return Builder instances rather than collections. Each Query class follows the established pattern of implementing a `builder()` method, allowing controllers to control pagination and result fetching.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
No direct API endpoints - Query classes are used internally by controllers.

### Controller Usage (Phase 7)
Query classes will be injected into controllers:
- `UserController::index()` will inject all three Query classes
- Controllers will call `$query->builder()->paginate(15)` or `$query->builder()->get()`

### Internal Dependencies
Query classes depend on:
- `App\Models\User` - For fetching user data
- `App\Models\Invitation` - For fetching invitation data
- `App\Models\Role` - For fetching role data
- Laravel's Eloquent Builder for query construction

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified

### Limitations
1. **Static Query Logic**
   - Description: Query classes have fixed ordering and relationships. Dynamic filtering (search, role filter, status filter) would need to be added in controllers or through query methods.
   - Reason: Following the simple Query pattern that encapsulates base query logic while allowing controllers to add specific filters.
   - Future Consideration: Could add optional filter methods like `whereRole($roleId)` or `search($term)` if needed for more complex filtering requirements.

2. **No Pagination Control**
   - Description: Query classes return Builder instances; controllers control pagination limits.
   - Reason: Provides flexibility for different use cases (some need pagination, others need all records).
   - Future Consideration: This is actually a design strength, not a limitation.

## Performance Considerations
- Eager loading of relationships prevents N+1 queries
- Queries use appropriate indexes (foreign keys are indexed by default in migrations)
- Ordering is done at the database level for efficiency
- PendingInvitationsQuery filters at the query level (not in PHP) for better performance
- No performance issues expected with typical dataset sizes (hundreds to thousands of users/invitations)

## Security Considerations
- Query classes contain no authorization logic (handled in controllers/middleware)
- No user input is directly used in queries (prevents SQL injection)
- Relationships are properly defined and type-safe
- Query results will be filtered through authorization in controllers

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
These Query classes are required by:
- **Phase 7: Controllers** - All three Query classes will be injected into `UserController`
- **Phase 13: Testing** - Controller tests will verify Query classes are properly used

## Notes
- The naming deviation (RolesQuery vs AllRolesQuery) improves code clarity and follows Laravel conventions
- All tests pass with 100% success rate
- Query classes are simple, focused, and follow single responsibility principle
- The builder pattern allows maximum flexibility for controllers while maintaining clean separation of concerns
- Generic type annotations provide excellent IDE support and static analysis
